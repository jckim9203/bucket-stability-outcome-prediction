# Assessing the quality of outcome-based business process predictive monitoring models
This repository handles the codes for the paper titled "Assessing the quality of outcome-based business process predictive monitoring models". The experiments use the approach proposed by Teinemaa et al. (2019).
### Overall bucket performance (OBP)
### Intra-bucket prediction stability (IBS)
### Cross-bucket performance stability (XBS)
